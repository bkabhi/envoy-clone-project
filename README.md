Currently, I am learning Full Stack Web Development at Masai. In the 5th unit, we learned about HTML, CSS, and javascript. In the last week of unit everyone has to do a project. 
I have cloned the website of **Envoy* with my teammates *Abhijeet Sagar, Shruti Joshi, Shivani.

*F*rom   people to packages, Envoy helps you handle everything that comes through your company’s front door. But your work doesn't end at the lobby and neither does ours.

We believe your office should work on your behalf, taking care of the details you'd rather forget so you can focus on more meaningful work.

That’s why we’re building smart tools, woven seamlessly throughout your workplace, that lessen your workload and brighten your day.

### Roles and Responsibilities
- All of us four worked simultaneously.
- We divided our work accordingly.
- Every day we connect and share our progress.


### Challenges faced
- We have faced challenges while merging our code as our CSS collapsed with each other.
- I have also faced some difficulties while making the website responsive.


### Conclusion 
After working on the project I came to know how important is teamwork. During the making of the project if any member face any difficulty others always try to help him.

I came to know the real meaning of TEAM:- Together Everyone Achieves More.

Every team member gave his best in order to make the project as good as it could be made.

The project repository is available on GitHub.
